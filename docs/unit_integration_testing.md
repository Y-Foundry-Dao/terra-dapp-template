# Unit and Integration Testing

This template sets up unit and integration tests using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)

## File Structure

For the sake of being able to find your test files easily it's standard practice to put your test file next to the component it is testing. This is shown in the template in `src/components/inputs/Input.test.tsx` and `src/components/inputs/Input.tsx`
