# End to End testing

This template sets up end to end testing using [playwright](https://playwright.dev/)

## File Structure

End to end tests are located in the directory `tests` because they are usually not tied to a specific component, but to your application as a whole.

- `playwright.config.ts` - this is the file which sets up your configuration for the playwright test runner based on the instructions outlined [here](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro#configuration-file)
